# 🎨 CG Online Academy Website

Forked for testing purposes

## 🖼️ Background

This is the link to the [original website](https://www.cgonline.biz/)

Goal of this project is to create a new website for my dad's business. The website will be built using React and Next.js.

My main goal and vision is to be able to display the 3d models and art in a visually appealing way, without overcrowding the website with too much information. I want to keep the website simple and easy to navigate, since the purpose is to show the courses and resources that are offered.

## ⌨️ Features/Ideas

- Usng webflow or a framework like three.js to display the 3d models on the website
- Have both English and Japanese version of the website
